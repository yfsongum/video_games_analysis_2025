We aim to understand how the same game performs across different platforms, how purchasing preferences vary across countries, and how game popularity evolves over time. Additionally, we will investigate the relationship between supported languages and sales, as well as the impact of pricing on game popularity across multiple platforms. By analyzing these factors, we hope to uncover insights into player behavior, market trends, and factors influencing game success."

Our project aims to answer the following real-world questions:\n",

        "1. **How do in-game achievements compare across different platforms for the same game?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - By analyzing achievement data, we aim to understand whether players engage with a game differently depending on the platform they use. This could reveal differences in play styles, game difficulty adjustments, or platform-specific engagement trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **How do game purchase preferences vary by country and active playtime?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - We seek to determine whether purchasing behaviors differ based on regional preferences and player engagement levels. Understanding this can help developers tailor their marketing strategies and optimize game pricing for different audiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **How has the popularity of different game types changed over time?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - By tracking shifts in game genre popularity over time, we hope to uncover trends that indicate the rise and fall of specific genres. This insight could be useful for predicting future market demands and guiding game development strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "By answering these questions, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the gaming landscape, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions about game development, pricing, and distribution strategies."

        "Our dataset contains multi-valued columns such as `developers`, `publishers`, `genres`, and `supported_languages`, which are stored as **list-like strings**. Instead of immediately expanding them into multiple rows (long format) or separate columns (one-hot encoding), we are **keeping them in their original format** for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Integrity & Storage Efficiency**  \n",
        "   - Expanding these fields would significantly increase row count, making storage and initial processing heavier.\n",
        "   - Keeping them as lists allows us to preserve all information within a single row per game.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Flexibility for Future Analysis**  \n",
        "   - At later stages, we may **apply one-hot encoding** to `genres` and `supported_languages` for categorical analysis.  \n",
        "   - Alternatively, we can derive **summary features** such as:\n",
        "     - **Number of genres per game**\n",
        "     - **Number of supported languages**\n",
        "     - **Unique count of developers/publishers**\n",
        "   - These derived features will allow for a more structured comparison across games.\n",
        "\n",
        "By postponing transformation, we maintain efficiency while keeping the option open for structured feature extraction when needed.\n"
